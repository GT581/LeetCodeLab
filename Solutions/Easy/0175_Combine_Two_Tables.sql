#175: Combine Two Tables

Difficulty:
Easy

Problem:

Table: Person

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| personId    | int     |
| lastName    | varchar |
| firstName   | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
personId is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
This table contains information about the ID of some persons and their first and last names.
 

Table: Address

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| addressId   | int     |
| personId    | int     |
| city        | varchar |
| state       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
addressId is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the city and state of one person with ID = PersonId.
 

Write a solution to report the first name, last name, city, and state of each person in the Person table. 
If the address of a personId is not present in the Address table, report null instead.

Return the result table in any order.

*/

-- Solution
SELECT 
    p.firstName,
    p.lastName,
    a.city,
    a.state
FROM 
    Person p
LEFT JOIN 
    Address a
ON 
    p.personId = a.personId;

/*
Explanation:

1. Use a LEFT JOIN because we want all people to show up, even if they don't have an address.
2. If a match is found in the Address table, the city and state will be filled, otherwise they will be NULL.
