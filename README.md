# LeetCode Solutions

This repository will contain solutions to various LeetCode problems organized by difficulty level. Each solution will be in Python with explanations of both the approach and time and space complexity.

## Structure

Solutions will be organized into three main directories based on difficulty:

- [`Easy/`](./Solutions/Easy)
- [`Medium/`](./Solutions/Medium)
- [`Hard/`](./Solutions/Hard)

## Planned Solution Format

Each solution file will follow a consistent format:

1. Problem description and constraints
2. Time and space complexity analysis
3. Example test cases with explanations
4. Detailed comments explaining the code and approach

## Problem List & Top Interview Questions

The full list of problems I have gathered in a CSV file here: [leetcode_problems.csv](./leetcode_problems.csv) 

This file contains:

- Problem Number
- Problem Name
- Difficulty Level
- Top 75 Flag (Y/N): Indicates if the problem is part of the "Blind 75" list of top interview questions
- Top 150 Flag (Y/N): Indicates if the problem is part of LeetCode's top 150 interview questions

## Test / Run Solutions

Each solution file will be able to be run independently, with example test cases that demonstrate how the solution works.
